Bubble Tea Shop
==============

This is an app to order from the nearest bubble tea shop.  The purpose of this project mainly is to see if web dev in Java could be as efficient as ruby on rails.  After all, I still love the static typed languages on the server side to have less bugs and avoid turn-over time.

Technologies used:

- Dropwizard (I initially did try to play with Play framework, but slow startup is sort of frustrating, so I switched to this framework which uses the super light-weight Jetty)
- AngularJS (angularJs certainly makes javascript more pleasant to work with)
- Bootstrap (A life saver for someone like me who is not good at the front-end css thing)
- MangoDB (TBD)
